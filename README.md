# zigboy

:construction: zigboy is a work-in-progress Game Boy emulator written in Zig :construction:

## Why?

I had fun building my [CHIP-8 emulator](https://github.com/bartek/zip-8) using
Zig and now I'm attempting the Game Boy. Of course, it's also an excuse to learn
Zig! Apart from minor dabbling with C++ in college, Zig is my introduction to a
lower level, "systems" language. A desire to get more comfortable with this
space!

## TODO

Everything
